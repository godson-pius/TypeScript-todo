This is a simple todo app with React TypeScript and json-server for database.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
and run
```bash
npm run json-server
# or
yarn run json-server
# or
pnpm run json-server
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/App.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses TypeScript
